        <!-- This changes the font of the title and paragraph text
             This link helped me change the font:
             https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_fonts.htm-->
        <font face = "Comic sans MS" size = "5">
            <!-- Displays the title
                 Source I used to understand how id works:
                 https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_id.asp-->
            <h1 id="main-title">Hello World</h1>
            <!-- This allows for the styles.css page to change the style of the text
                 This link taught me to use external CSS stylesheet:
